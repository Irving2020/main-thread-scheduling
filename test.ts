// ðŸ‘‹ Hey!
// I see you want to see the library tests...

// Previously, the library had tests:
// https://github.com/astoilkov/main-thread-scheduling/blob/0b9797e7bdaf1a4cf375c1be837d66c216459048/test.ts
// However, they were slowing the development and experimentation process, so I removed them.
// I now use the `playground` folder to test the library.
// In the future, when the library is more mature, I will add tests again.
